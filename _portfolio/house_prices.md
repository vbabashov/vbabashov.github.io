title: "House Price Prediction (Regression) Project"
excerpt: "In this project, I'll develop prediction models using the house prices dataset from Aimes, IA. The goal is to demonstrate the 4 steps of the Data Science project lifecycle: Define, Discover, Develop and Deploy. First, I'll establish simple baseline model using the OLS regression, and then I'll develop a few predictive models, namely, random forest, xgboost and lightgbm regression models and compare the performance of these models against the baseline with the aim to get better predictive performance. The implementation of similar price prediction models will potentially allow the housing agencies (e.g., CMHC in Canada), real-estate companies, central and commercial banks, municipial governments and home buyers to make informed decisions with respect to market pricing.[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vbabashov/house-prices)"
