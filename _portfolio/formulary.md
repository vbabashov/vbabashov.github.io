title: "Drug Formulary Design Project"
excerpt: "Canada is the 10th largest pharmaceutical market in the world. In 2015, drug sales amounted to $25 billion dollars. Public and private plans constitute 42% and 58% of the drug insurance market respectively. Generics drugs sell at an average of 36% of brand prices and 2/3 of prescriptions represent 1/4 of drug expenditures. The goal of this project is to provide a method that helps determine if a new drug should be included in the formulary and whether an existing (i.e., covered) drug should be excluded from the formulary using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis.
