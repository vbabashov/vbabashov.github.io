title: "Do We Have To Wait So Long?"
excerpt: "In the current clinical practice, priority-specific wait time targets are typically determined by the consensus of medical specialists and healthcare administrators. The problem with this rationale is that it does not consider the efficient use of clinical resources and the patient volume associated with each class. The aim of this method presented here is to determine wait time targets in a multi-priority patient setting in a systematic fashion that both respects clinically acceptable wait time targets and considers clinic size and demand distribution. This approach utilizes predictive, prescriptive and descriptive analytics. More specifically, simulation, deep neural network, regression, and inverse optimization approacheds are used.
