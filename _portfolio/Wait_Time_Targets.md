title: "Wait Time Targets"
excerpt: "In the current clinical practice, priority-specific wait time targets are typically determined by the consensus of medical specialists and healthcare administrators. The problem with this rationale is that it does not consider the efficient use of clinical resources and the patient volume associated with each class. The method presented here utilizes predictive, prescriptive and descriptive analytics. Click here for the [Github](https://github.com/vbabashov/wait-time-targets) repository."
