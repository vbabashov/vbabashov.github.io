title: "Bank Note Demand Forecasting"
excerpt: "A central bank of Canada runs a distribution network and maintains an inventory of bank of notes at regional distribution points for multiple types of denominations. Both shortage and capacity overage of notes at the regional inventories need to be avoided. The goal of this research exploration is to come up with a forecasting model that can help the Bank Note Distribution System (BNDS) operations team to provide right amount of notes in the right place at the right time. Implemented models include classical time series approaches such as STL decomposition, TBATS, Dynamic Harmonic Regression (i.e., Arima with harmonic terms) and deep neural network approaches such as Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) and Light Gradient Boosting Method (LightGBM).
