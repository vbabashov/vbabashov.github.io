title: "Follow-up Patient Scheduling"
excerpt: "In many healthcare systems patients require multiple visits to a healthcare provider. In general, the first visit 
is known as the consult visit and all the subsequent visits are known as the follow-up visits. The later typically occur 
according to predefined booking guidelines. A Markov Decision Process model is used to efficiently allocate 
available capacity to consults and follow-up visits in a dynamic fashion. To solve this model, a linear 
programming approach to Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) is used. The characteristics of the approximate optimal booking (AOP) policy for a multi-class patient setting 
is obtained through simulation."
