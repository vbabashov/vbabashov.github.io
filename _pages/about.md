Iâ€™m a Ph.D candidate in Advanced Analytics at Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa. 

My research interests surround machine learning and operations research in healthcare and finance.

I am very passionate about solving the complex real life problems with the aid of analytics whenever possible.
